<h1>ICT Project: Precious Plastics</h1>
<p>Precious Plastic is an open source project to promote plastic recycling around the world.

They do this by making tools and knowledge available to people around the world for free. Just sign up to join their plastic fighting "army" and get access to a variety of mills, extruder plans and 3D printing plans to suit every use of different types of plastics. You can also meet their community members who can help you solve problems, share ideas and sell/buy products made from recycled plastic.</p>
